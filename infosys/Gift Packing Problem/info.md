# Gift Packing Problem

## Problem Statement

Wael wants to play Sante this year, so he prepared gifts for all the Children of the neighborhood. He decided to pack the gifts in boxes and give each child a box. Let's define the Value of the box as the number of distinct types of gifts inside this box. Wael has N gifts, such that the type of each gift is A[i]. Wael wants to pack exactly K boxes, and he has to put on each box a sub-array of consecutive gifts. Wael wants to maximize the total value of all boxes with gifts.

## Input Format

* The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in A.
* The next line contains an integer K, denoting the number of boxes.
* Each line of the N subsequent lines (where 0 < i < N) contains an integer describing A[i].

## Task

Your task is to help Wael determine this maximum possible value.

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
* 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^3
* 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9

## Output Format

Print the maximum possible value.
